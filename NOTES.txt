INTRO TO REACT CONTEXT API

React app contains two main things 
1.state
2.components

Basically need of context api is that
let suppose we have a structure like 

                app.js
                  |
            ______|_________
            |   |     |    |  
            c1  c2    c3   c4
                |          |
                c5        c7(let color red chye)
                |
                c6(let color:red chye)

To full fill nedd of all this first we have to create the state in app.js then we pass (props to c2->c3->c4 after that we will able to use it)
These is very hectic task and in complex applications like(amazon it will become more hectic)

to avoid this we create a context api though which we do all these task 
and all the variable is use a hook called (useContext(value))

just check (video no 58 if you forget syntax how to use)
